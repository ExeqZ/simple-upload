## Overview
**Simple Upload** is a modern, secure web application for uploading one or multiple files to an Azure Blob Storage container.

- Modern, clear, and responsive UI
- Uses Azure Managed Identity for storage access
- Easy deployment to Azure using ARM templates

## Prerequisites
- Azure subscription
- Python 3.11+ and pip
- Node.js and npm (for the React client)
