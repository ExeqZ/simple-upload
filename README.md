# Simple Upload

## Overview
**Simple Upload** is a modern, secure web application for uploading one or multiple files to an Azure Blob Storage container. The app features a clean, intuitive React interface and a Node.js/Express backend. It uses Azure Managed Identity for secure accessâ€”no secrets or SAS keys are stored in code or configuration.

## Features
- Upload single or multiple files (including large files)
- Modern, clear, and responsive UI
- Uses Azure Managed Identity for storage access
- Easy deployment to Azure

## Prerequisites
- Azure subscription
- Node.js and npm

## Quick Deploy

> **Note:** The "Deploy to Azure" button requires a JSON ARM template.  
> Make sure `infra/azuredeploy.json` exists and is up-to-date.  
> If you see a download error, compile the Bicep file to JSON and push it to your repo.
