# Simple Upload

## Overview
**Simple Upload** is a secure web application for uploading one or multiple files to an Azure Blob Storage container. The app features a Python Flask backend and uses Azure Managed Identity for secure accessâ€”no secrets or SAS keys are stored in code or configuration.

## Features
- Upload single or multiple files (including large files)
- Uses Azure Managed Identity for storage access
- Easy deployment to Azure using ARM templates

## Prerequisites
- Azure subscription
- Python 3.11+ and pip

## Quick Deploy

[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FExeqZ%2Fsimple-upload%2Fmain%2Finfra%2Fazuredeploy.json)

> The "Deploy to Azure" button uses an ARM template (`infra/azuredeploy.json`).  
> After deployment, assign the "Storage Blob Data Contributor" role to the Web App's managed identity on the Storage Account.

## Azure Deployment

- The ARM template provisions a Linux App Service with Python 3.11.
- Deploy using the Azure Portal or CLI as before.
- After deployment, assign the "Storage Blob Data Contributor" role to the Web App's managed identity on the Storage Account.

## Security
